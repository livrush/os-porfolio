        <h1>Yo yo yo!</h1>
        <h2>Check it out!</h2>
        <h3>It's a website, yo!</h3>
        <h4>I'M CODING HERE!!!!!!!</h4>
        <h5>There's hannukah songs playing in the background!</h5>
        <h6>But this website is secular.</h6>
        <p>Did you know? When I was in high school I took a computer apps class and one of the projects was creating a website. I'm pretty sure it was, at least. I made a website for some class. <i>It wasn't very good</i>. But I still did it!</p>
        <p>The point of this whole thing is to say that I may or may not have talked about <b>Shiina Ringo</b> on that website as well. I remember specifically making a page for <b>Capsule</b> in regards to the music I cared about at the time, but can't remember if I actually put Ringo in there as well.</p>
        <p>It's funny because at the time, and as time has gone by, Shiina Ringo is by far the better musician. Well, that's not true. I shouldn't make a factual statement like that, that's just an opinion. I still like Yasutaka Nakata's music fine, but my love for Ringo's music has grown rather than plateaued. Of course this entire paragraph taking back my factually stated opinion and then clarifying it as an opinion was just an excuse to fill this paragraph up with text. Thank you, college.</p>

You're thinking it, right? Milk? Sure. Who cares. I'll tell you what Bobby, <i>I</i> care. I'm a milk enthusiast. If you want to give me strawberry milk, chocolate milk, I'll drink it. A good 2%? Goin' down my throat. I'll swallow that liquid. Yeah. Give me like some cake to go along with it and I'll be happy. But maybe I want something a little bit more harty? Then you should give me some turkey or something. I like the white meat. Did you know I cooked a turkey all on my own for the first time this year? I did it the day after thanksgiving, because that I way I got to eat <b>all of it myself!</b> And also there was no stress~ But then I left all my white meat in a plastic thing and the dark meat in a separate one, and I told my housemates they could eat the dark meat because I don't like it but please don't eat the white meat, and then I got home after a long shitty day and someone had eaten all my white meat! I almost went nuclear on my housemates, but then I decided it wasn't worth it.</p></div>
